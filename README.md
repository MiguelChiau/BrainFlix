# Summary

This project consists of three sprints: sprint I, sprint II and sprint III.
The app is a prototype for a video streaming platform called BrainFlix, a React single page application using react-router to create a multi-page functionality. As well as using NPM with the necessary JavaScript libraries and implement a mock API. In the final sprint the challenge was to move away from a mock API and build and actual API with the following end-points: GET/videos that responds with an array of videos; GET/videos/:id that responds with an object containing the details of the video with id of :id; POST/videos that will add a new video to the video list.
